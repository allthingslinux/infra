# RBAC Pattern Comparison

## Overview

Different organizations use different RBAC patterns based on their size, complexity, and security requirements. Here's a comparison of common approaches:

## 1. **GitHub Pattern** - Simple Permission Levels

### Pros

- ✅ **Simple to understand**: Read, Write, Admin, Owner
- ✅ **Clear escalation path**: Each level includes previous permissions
- ✅ **Team-based**: Easy to manage groups of users
- ✅ **Repository-specific**: Fine-grained control per repository
- ✅ **Industry standard**: Widely understood

### Cons

- ❌ **Limited granularity**: Only 4 permission levels
- ❌ **Not infrastructure-focused**: Designed for code repositories
- ❌ **No time-based restrictions**: No built-in access windows

### Best For

- Small to medium organizations
- Development-focused teams
- Organizations with simple infrastructure

## 2. **Kubernetes Pattern** - Resource-Based Permissions

### Pros

- ✅ **Highly granular**: Fine-grained control over resources
- ✅ **API-focused**: Designed for programmatic access
- ✅ **Namespace isolation**: Clear resource boundaries
- ✅ **Service accounts**: Good for automation
- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new resources

### Cons

- ❌ **Complex**: Many concepts to understand
- ❌ **Kubernetes-specific**: May not translate to other systems
- ❌ **Overkill for simple setups**: Too much complexity for small teams

### Best For

- Kubernetes-heavy environments
- Organizations with complex microservices
- Teams that need fine-grained control

## 3. **AWS IAM Pattern** - Action-Based Permissions

### Pros

- ✅ **Action-focused**: Clear what each permission does
- ✅ **Resource ARNs**: Precise resource targeting
- ✅ **Conditional policies**: Time-based and context-aware
- ✅ **Role-based**: Good for temporary access
- ✅ **Mature**: Well-established patterns

### Cons

- ❌ **Verbose**: Many permissions to manage
- ❌ **AWS-specific**: Tied to AWS services
- ❌ **Complex policies**: JSON policies can be hard to read

### Best For

- AWS-heavy environments
- Organizations with complex cloud infrastructure
- Teams that need temporary access patterns

## 4. **Google Cloud IAM Pattern** - Resource Hierarchy

### Pros

- ✅ **Hierarchical**: Inherits permissions from parent resources
- ✅ **Predefined roles**: Good starting point
- ✅ **Conditional access**: Time and context-based restrictions
- ✅ **Service accounts**: Good for automation
- ✅ **Project isolation**: Clear boundaries

### Cons

- ❌ **GCP-specific**: Tied to Google Cloud
- ❌ **Complex hierarchy**: Resource inheritance can be confusing
- ❌ **Limited customization**: Predefined roles may not fit all needs

### Best For

- Google Cloud environments
- Organizations with clear resource hierarchy
- Teams that want predefined roles

## 5. **Simple Permission Pattern** - Minimal Approach

### Pros

- ✅ **Easy to understand**: Just Read, Write, Admin
- ✅ **Quick to implement**: Minimal configuration
- ✅ **Flexible**: Easy to adapt to different needs
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Simple to manage and debug
- ✅ **Universal**: Works for any type of resource

### Cons

- ❌ **Limited granularity**: Only 3 permission levels
- ❌ **No built-in features**: No time restrictions, conditions, etc.
- ❌ **Manual management**: More work for complex scenarios

### Best For

- Small organizations
- Simple infrastructure
- Teams that want minimal complexity

## Recommendation for Your Infrastructure

Based on your infrastructure setup, I'd recommend a **hybrid approach** combining the best of multiple patterns:

### **Recommended Pattern: Enhanced Simple Pattern**

```yaml
# Core permission levels (like GitHub)
permissions:
  read: "View resources"
  write: "Modify resources"
  admin: "Full control"

# Resource types (like Kubernetes)
resources:
  infrastructure: ["servers", "networks", "storage"]
  applications: ["web", "api", "database"]
  security: ["monitoring", "audit", "secrets"]

# User groups (like simple pattern)
groups:
  developers:
    permissions: "write"
    resources: ["applications"]

  devops:
    permissions: "admin"
    resources: ["infrastructure", "applications"]

  security:
    permissions: "admin"
    resources: ["security", "infrastructure"]

# Time-based access (like GCP)
access_control:
  business_hours: "09:00-17:00"
  emergency_access: "24/7"
  on_call_access: "24/7"

# Conditional access (like AWS)
conditions:
  production_access:
    required_groups: ["devops", "security"]
    approval_required: true
```

### **Why This Approach:**

1. **Simple to understand**: Clear permission levels
2. **Flexible**: Easy to add new resources and groups
3. **Security-focused**: Built-in time restrictions and approvals
4. **Infrastructure-appropriate**: Designed for your use case
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to manage and debug

### **Implementation:**

```bash
# Deploy the enhanced simple pattern
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/users/rbac-management.yml

# Add users to groups
# Edit ansible/group_vars/rbac-users.yml
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/users/rbac-management.yml
```

This gives you the simplicity of the basic pattern with the security features you need, without the complexity of enterprise patterns that might be overkill for your infrastructure.
