# Gitleaks ignore file for All Things Linux Infrastructure
# This file contains fingerprints of findings that should be ignored
# Each line should contain a finding fingerprint that you want to ignore
#
# To get the fingerprint of a finding, run gitleaks and copy the
# "Fingerprint" value from the output
#
# Example:
# abc123def456:path/to/file.txt:rule-id:42
#
# You can also add comments by starting lines with #

# Example ignored findings (remove these and add your actual fingerprints):
# 1234567890abcdef:docs/example.md:generic-api-key:15
# abcdef1234567890:terraform/example.tf:aws-access-token:23

# Legacy findings that existed before gitleaks implementation
# (Add fingerprints here for any secrets that were already present and approved)

# Approved test/example secrets in documentation
# (Add fingerprints for secrets in docs that are safe examples)

# Infrastructure template secrets that are replaced in deployment
# (Add fingerprints for template values that look like secrets but aren't real)
