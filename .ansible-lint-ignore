# Ansible Lint Ignore File for All Things Linux Infrastructure
# Format: filename rule-id [skip] [# comment]
#
# Using this file is preferred over skip_list in .ansible-lint because
# it makes ignored rules visible in output, helping track technical debt
#
# Add 'skip' keyword to completely suppress warnings for that rule
# Without 'skip', rules are ignored but still show as warnings
